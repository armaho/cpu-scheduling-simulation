# Test Case

We have four tasks:

- **T1**: duration = 10,  arrival = 2
- **T2**: duration = 12,  arrival = 3
- **T3**: duration = 4,   arrival = 4
- **T4**: duration = 6,   arrival = 4

Here's the output for each scheduling algorithm:

## RR

Round Robin with quantum time = 3:

```
Average Waiting Time: 11.75
Average Turnaround Time: 19.75
Average Response Time: 11.75
```

## SJF

```
Average Waiting Time: 9.25
Average Turnaround Time: 17.25
Average Response Time: 9.25
```

## FCFS

```
Average Waiting Time: 12.25
Average Turnaround Time: 20.25
Average Response Time: 12.25
```
